# ðŸ‘‹ HELLO WORLD, I'm Muhammad Zahid

## ðŸ§  About Me

Self-motivated and detail-oriented aspiring Full-Stack Developer with a strong foundation in web technologies including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Currently advancing my skills through focused self-study and structured programs like 100Devs and the AZNext Web Developer Cohort (July 2025), where Iâ€™m continuing to build on foundations and further proficiency in Node.js, React, and PostgreSQL. 
I'm also pursuing a second Bachelorâ€™s degree at Arizona State University. Outside of tech, I have a deep curiosity for systems (whether medical or mechanical), and I enjoy exploring how things work, both in code and in the real world.
